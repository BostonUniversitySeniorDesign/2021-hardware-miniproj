# 2021 Hardware Miniproject

Fall 2021 ECE Senior Capstone miniproject

This project will be done in multiple steps.
The first part is the setup of the Raspberry Pi hardware.

The second part is an exercise to gain familiarity with Python and embedded sensors. It will require the Raspberry Pi OS to be working. It will be released Monday, September 6, 2021.

The third part using the Raspberry Pi as a wireless sensor will be released Thursday, September 9, 2021.

## Part 1: setup Raspberry Pi

The Raspberry Pi requires the students obtain a micro-SD card and install the Raspberry Pi OS.
8GB or larger micro SD card recommended--these days, 32 GB is often the minimum size one finds commonly available.
An 32GB micro SD UHS-1 card is about $5 from:

* Microcenter (730 Memorial Drive, Cambridge--just across BU Bridge)
* Amazon
* many other places

The Raspberry Pi OS is a freely available fork of Debian customized for the Raspberry Pi.
To install the OS, the student team will need to
[download the OS image](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/)
via the installer to the SD card.
Please use care that the installer refers to the path to the SD card.
If your computer doesn't have a micro SD slot, consider buying an inexpensive USB to micro SD adapter or using another computer.

NOTE: if you have trouble with the laptop crashing while writing or verifying the SD card, try temporarily turning off virus protection, especially on Windows.

We have setup a few HDMI displays and USB keyboards in the senior design lab to share.
Please let us know if we need to add more.
